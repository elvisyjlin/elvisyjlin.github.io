I've been working on an [OpenAI](https://openai.com)-related project since I returned to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) in March.

I led a team of 7 to participate in [Hack-a-TONx w/ DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hack-a-tonx), a.k.a TON Hackathon, and we **got the Top 10 ($5,000 Award)** out of 233 builds. We are [1TON](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/4580).

We also **won the 1st Prize** of [Taipei TON Hackathon](https://www.blocktempo.com/taipei-ton-hackathon-registration-is-now-open/). There were around 50 applications in total, and 8 teams were selected to attend the on-site competition.
